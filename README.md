## Working with clusters
On this repository, I'll store my python scripts and Jupyter notebooks concerning my work on clusters.
It will be divided in several parts such as
 * AMICO which is at the moment the main part of my work.
 * DC2 which concerns files for pre treatment catalogs (mainly masks)
 * cluster comparison project which is strongly related to AMICO but allows me to code things concerning cluster comparison project package on my side and more related to my work.
